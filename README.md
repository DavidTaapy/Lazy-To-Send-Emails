# Lazy-To-Send-Emails

Tired of sending the same emails constantly with different names, I decided it's time to write a script to automate the process

Inputs required:
- CSV file with the information
- Python script
- SMTP Information of Email
- Valid Account Address & Password

With these inputs, upon successful logging in, the script can send out these emails automatically!
